# Credit Card Fraud Detection
Classifying fraudulent credit card transactions from open source Credit Card Transaction Data

## Data source

The open source data used in this project is the [MLB-ULB Credit Card Transaction Data](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Guide

The different aspects of this project have been broken down into different .py files:

1. Explore data.py 
2. Feature Selection.py
3. Data Balancing.py
4. Models.py

Please note that since the dataset used is pretty large, running code can take some time, especially the wrapper-type Feature Selection models. 

## Project Next Steps

1. Identify appropriate performance measures to evaluate models
2. Tweak parameters and run models, with different combinations of feature selection and data balancing tools
3. Identify "winning" model combination

## Acknowledgements

The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Université Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.
