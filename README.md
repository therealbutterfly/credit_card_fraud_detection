# Credit Card Fraud Detection
Classifying fraudulent credit card transactions from open source Credit Card Transaction Data

## Data source

The open source data used in this project is the [MLB-ULB Credit Card Transaction Data](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Guide

This project can be broken down into the following steps, each step is organized in the following files:



## Acknowledgements

The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Université Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.
